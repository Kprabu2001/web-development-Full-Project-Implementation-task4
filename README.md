Apex Planet – Task 4: Full Project Implementation
  =>This repository is part of my Web Development Training with Apex Planet Software Pvt Ltd.
In Task 4, I brought together all the concepts learned in previous tasks and built three complete projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✅ What I built

Personal Portfolio Website → A multi-page style, responsive portfolio with About, Projects, and Contact sections.

To-Do List App → A task manager with localStorage persistence, add/delete tasks, and dynamic updates.

Product Listing Page → Displays products with filtering, searching, and sorting features for better interactivity.

🛠️ Technologies Used

=> HTML5 for structure

=> CSS3 (responsive design, layouts, media queries)

=> JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity, data storage, and dynamic UI
